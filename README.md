# The Novelist

You love writing, but your notebook is full? You have multiple notebooks, stored with ideas and information? Your chars have multiple generations you want to write about?

The Novelist is your new project to get the most out of your novels, books and storys. Developed from an independent novelist, it contains every possible features, you ever wanted to have.

As I am right now, it is very difficult to work on something, cause I have to start from scratch. Sure I can implement the base function quickly, but I want to provide the most efficent software for everyone. So I have to ask you to stay tuned, cause it will take time to produce something. 

In the future I will improve this Readme file and add everything you have to know. So please stay tuned and support "The Novelist"

Right now the core Feature - the Text Editor - is now online. You can either make the Installer Project yourself or you wait to get the Link to the download for the Installer.
